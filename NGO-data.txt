Our Journey Towards a Better Future: Igniting Hope with the All Round Social Development Association

Dear Friends, Colleagues, and Well-Wishers,

I, Hari Singh, as the President of the All Round Social Development Association (Regd.) Delhi, am delighted to share the successful journey of our organization. Founded with the passion to serve the most vulnerable sections of society, we continue to move forward with this commitment.

This year, we have quadrupled our scholarship amounts for deserving students to access quality education. Our regular medical camps have benefited thousands through homeopathy, Ayurveda, and allopathic treatments. We conduct free daily eye check-up camps in Delhi, including remote villages, referring cataract patients to government hospitals for free surgeries.

Our team is devoted not only to social service but also to environmental protection and animal welfare. We encourage youth volunteerism, bringing new energy into our activities.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to expanding our efforts in education, environment, and community development. We invite all to join us in this noble mission to create a better future.

Thank you,

Hari Singh
President
All Round Social Development Association (Regd.), Delhi
